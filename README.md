# Frogger - CPSC 359 Final Project

By Stephen Ng 30038689


fn, control, option, f1 - opens the gui console
fn, control, option, f7 - closes console

To test on a 1080p display, go into 'var.c' and change the 'bWidth' and 'bHeight' to set a border to center the frame.
For 720p use, leave those border values as 0 - hopefully they don't cause a segmentation fault on a 720p monitor.

Use the directional pad on the SNES to select options, and use the 'A' button to confirm the selection.

There are 4 challenges:
- Crossing a road - cars are dangerous
- Crossing rivers - logs and lilypads are safe
- Crossing space (astronaut frog!!) - rockets and satelites are safe
- Crossing a field - lawnmowers are dangerous

In each challenge, the value-pack (a star) can be obtained to gain a life, and add 10 seconds to the time left.




This was written on a Mac via Sublime Text and tested on a 1080p monitor (I didn't have a 720p monitor available).
